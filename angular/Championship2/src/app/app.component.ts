/**
 * This is a programming Excercise.  Specifications are published by NTTDATA
 * 
 * In this version the data can be found in the data folder. 
 * In a next version they should come from a server. For this reason, 
 * some points where the changes will be made have been indicated in the "info.service" Service. 
 * As well as eliminating the data processing programming that is currently in JavaScript.
 * 
 * To coordinate the components, the services of "view-coordination.service" is used,
 * to make visible only the component that is used.
 * This could be done using pages. And make some changes to the html page to jump to another page.
